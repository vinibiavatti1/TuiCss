### About

TuiCss is a library focused to create web applications using an interface based on ASCII table, like the old MS-DOS applications. This kind of interface is very legible because the ultra-contrast colors used and because the reduced effects used on the components in the view. The base of this project is  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Vision">Turbo Vision Framework</a>, but some other frameworks were also checked to introduce some features to TuiCss, like [curses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)), [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses), [Newt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newt_(programming_library)), etc. Check the examples page in the wiki to stay on top of some creations, or check the getting started page to start using this library!
